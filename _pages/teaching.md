            This course is the second in a series for doctoral students in political science, focusing on advanced applications and topics in game theory. Building on the foundational concepts covered in Game Theory I, this course delves into specific areas of political science, such as legislature, lobbying, elections, conflict, and development. Additionally, the course covers various methodological aspects of game theory, including signaling, voting, bargaining, and testing game theory through observational and experimental methods, as well as examining the concept of bounded rationality and quantal response equilibrium.
