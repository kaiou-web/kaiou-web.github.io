I am an associate professor in the Department of Political Science at Florida State University. 

I study behavioral choice patterns using theoretical and experimental tools. My research focuses on institutional effects on economic and political behavior. I study voting and elections, political donation, and competition and coordination between ethnic groups. 

Before joining Florida State University, I received a Ph.D. in Politics from New York University. 

I teach behavioral political economy, behavioral game theory, quantitative methods, and experimental methods for undergraduate and graduate students.
