  title={Race to the Top: How Competition for Political Power Affects Participation},
  author={Ou, Kai},
  abstract={In politics, power is key. Engaging in competitive political environments and gaining political power through competition can have significant ramifications on an individual's financial and interpersonal life and influence how individuals behave politically. I hypothesize that competition for political power causes voters to place more value on the importance of participation, and it triggers a strong desire to seek economic status by using power, which mobilizes political participation. Using behavioral theory and three laboratory experiments, I find evidence supporting these effects. I take special care to distinguish these effects from those induced by endogenous formation of group identity, strategic voting, and other compelling behavioral theories. Substantively, I discuss the implications of these findings in the context of how the civil rights movement affected Black votersâ€™ participation, how the process of immigration affects immigrants' political behavior, and how empowering women in the political processes influences women's participation.},

  title={What motivates bandwagon voting behavior: Altruism or a desire to win?},
  author={Morton, Rebecca B and Ou, Kai},
  abstract={This paper surveys the literature on psychological and strategic mental processes of bandwagon behavior, discusses the literature of bandwagon behavior in the context of the two different types, bandwagon vote choices and bandwagon abstention effects, and examines the rationality of other-regarding bandwagon vote choices. Key experimental results are reported to investigate the extent that bandwagon behavior can be explained by other-regarding preferences in contrast to a psychological desire to simply support a winner. We find support for purely psychological non-other-regarding bandwagon behavior but primarily when subjects have information about the distribution of voter choices in previous elections but individual choices are private. Interestingly, when voting is public this type of bandwagon behavior disappears and bandwagon behavior that could be other-regrading is much higher. Given that observability increases other-regarding behavior in other contexts, our results suggest that some of the observed bandwagon behavior may be explained by other-regarding preferences as well.},
